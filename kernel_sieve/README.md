# KernelSieve

This folder contains the client and kernel module of KernelSieve.

To build the client:
```bash
$ cd client/
$ gcc kernel_sieve.c -static -o kernel_sieve
```

To build the kernel module:
```bash
$ cd kernel_module/
$ make
```

Ensure that you already run `setup.sh` from the first step as described in [RUNNING_KEVOHEAP.md](https://github.com/fkie-cad/Algorithmic-Heap-Layout-Manipulation-in-the-Linux-Kernel/blob/main/RUNNING_KEVOHEAP.md). This make file expects in the folder above a directory `kernel_src` which is generated by `setup.sh`.


More information about its usage can be found in [RUNNING_KEVOHEAP.md](https://github.com/fkie-cad/Algorithmic-Heap-Layout-Manipulation-in-the-Linux-Kernel/blob/main/RUNNING_KEVOHEAP.md).
