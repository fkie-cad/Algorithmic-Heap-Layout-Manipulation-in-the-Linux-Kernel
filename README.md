# Algorithmic Heap Layout Manipulation in the Linux Kernel

This repository contains the code and auxilliary tools for the Paper "Algorithmic Heap Layout Manipulation in the Linux Kernel". For information on how to setup and run KEvoHeap, see [RUNNING_KEVOHEAP.md](https://gitlab.fkie.fraunhofer.de/daniel.baier/lab_pcap_monitoring/-/blob/cfp/RUNNING_KEVOHEAP.md) (LINK AM ENDE UPDATEN). The "ftrace" folder contains instructions and tools for debugging memory allocation using ftrace. The "visualisation" folder contains scripts to visualize candidate solutions in an animated fashion. The "exploit" folder contains an exemplary exploit for the given vulnerable kernel module (found in "vuln").
